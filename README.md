# Welcome!

This is the resume project from the User Centric Frontend Design module for CodeInstitute.

#### Notes:

- All CSS and HTML code has been validated by the W3C validators
- Errors in CSS regarding unknown vendor extensions are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that vendor extensions are proprietary and thus will always be invalid in standard CSS
- Errors in HTML regarding `dates` attributes on `<div>` tags are unavoidable and insignificant. These are due to the fact that `dates` is a custom attribute used to style our CSS timeline
